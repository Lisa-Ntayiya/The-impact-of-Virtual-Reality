                              <p class="tech-paragraph">To solve the first problem ,which is “traditional education” . I want to use virtual reality to change
                                the way learners learn and teachers teach. I want learners to experience education in way that
                                is more immersive and engaging . Virtual reality can take students from their desks to a world of
                                wonder where they don’t just hear what they are being taught ,they see it and they can interact
                                with it . Where they can be able to mix volatile chemicals without physically hurting themselves.

                                Teachers can be able to create conditions for exploring rather than providing knowledge that
                                has been made ready. Students that miss a class or lesson they will be able to visit the lessons
                                they have missed as if they were in class through virtual reality. Students can learn by actually
                                performing tasks than just simply reading . Teachers and learners are able to create more
                                memorable experience . Students are able to be more creative . Visual learners can finally do
                                better academically. Virtual reality eliminates costs and distance barriers.

                                or concur their fears. Whether a person has a fear of heights , failure or stress from a past
                                incident, virtual reality can assist such a person by becoming a therapeutic measure for that
                                person . Virtual reality gives people a chance to experience their fears without living through
                                them in real-time. Virtual reality can create people’s worst fears through 3D virtual reality

                                goggles that enable people to fully be in scenes related to their fears . With virtual reality people
                                can wear headsets and immerse themselves in a specific scenario and can be monitored during
                                the whole process .
                                People can hear, feel and even smell certain aspects of their virtual experience with therapist or
                                someone else besides them to remove them from the situation if fear becomes too much to
                                bear. Virtual reality is a more impactful way to deal with fear and anxiety and it has the most
                                results during a short period of time of using it . It offers an eye-opening experience to people
                                where they can learn that their fears do not define them and they can overcome them.

                              <p class="tech-paragraph">All of these can be done using virtual reality therapy. Virtual reality therapy does not always
                                relieve the full fear or anxiety but it can minimize it to a manageable level. When people
                                experience virtual reality therapy through a headset ,they can learn that their feelings are
                                survival and something bad does not always happen.It is much easier to convince people to
                                face their fears through virtual reality therapy than in real life and as a person continues with
                                virtual reality therapy they can have the confidence to finally face their fears in real life.</p>
